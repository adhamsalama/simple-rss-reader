# Acknowledgments

Many thanks to [MobiWriter](https://github.com/cafaxo/MobiWriter) for implementing an HTML to MOBI conversion program in C++, which Claude Code was able to port to pure JavaScript. I tried to make several AI models implement an HTML to MOBI conversion, but they failed, until I pointed Claude Code to the MobiWriter implementation and asked it to port it to JavaScript, so this wasn't doable without your useful repo.
